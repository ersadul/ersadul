at this time I learned about the basics of operating Docker. In docker we can deploy apps easily and quickly. And we can upload it to our private repo, so that we or others can run it over the internet.

The course begins with the understanding and concepts of docker when compared to virtual machines. Then move on to the concept of docker architecture and its components.
In its application, we are required to take and create our own image, which is then extracted into a container. On the container we can operate applications related to the image that we use.
We can also connect the network between containers so that they are integrated with each other. In this case we can take advantage of environment variable feature to set the address and port of the application that we want to connect.
Docker itself has a feature that makes it easier for us to run containers as explained earlier. We can take advantage of the docker-compose feature, where we only run one .yaml file to operate it all.
And lastly, in this course we learn auxiliary materials for container management purposes such as: container operation via bash, cleaning data on docker, and uploading images on docker hub

In closing, I can conclude that Docker is a very helpful tool in deploying the application to the server or local. This is very useful if we are in the production application stage, we can add service applications or remove applications quickly.
